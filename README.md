This is a web app that recognises handwritten digits between 0 and 9.  The prediction is made using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the well-known MNIST database.

The user draws a digit on the slate and then presses the predict button.  If the app predicts wrong, the user types in the correct number and presses the submit feedback button.

## üß† Model Weights

This repo includes a pre-trained CNN for MNIST digit recognition:

- `app/mnist_cnn.pth` ‚Äî weights for a small CNN trained on the MNIST dataset

You can retrain your own using `CNNModelMNIST.py` or swap in a different `.pth`.

## Deployment
  2 Docker containers
  Hosted on Hetzner VPS Instance
 - Streamlit
 - PostGres DB

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Init

On first run, the `init.sql` script (in `db/init.sql`) sets up the PostgreSQL schema for logging predictions.

Docker Compose handles this automatically.
